This project uses computer vision and deep learning to draw bounding boxes around Overwatch heroes. The goal of this project is to accurately draw bounding boxes around Soldier 76 
and be able to train a reinforcement learning agent to track and follow soldier 76. So far Computer vision has been used to draw boounding boxes around many overwatch heroes. See the
